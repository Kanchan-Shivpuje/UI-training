		<h2>Chemical Formula of Common Compounds</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Chemistry</b> is said to be a subject mostly comprising of reactions 
			along with formulas. We come across various chemical substances in
			our daily life. Some of the substances we use in our house such as 
			the staples present in the medicine cabinet comprise chemical substances.
			All these chemicals are bound up with atoms in a fixed proportion and also
			these are arranged in a certain way. So, to figure out what kind of proportions
			are these and their arrangement within the substance, the chemical formula is more needed.

		<h4> Some Common Chemical Formulae:</h4>
		
		<p>1. Aluminium chloride formula : AlCl<sub>3</sub> </p>
		<p>2. Water Formula : H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
		<p>3. Carbon dioxide Formula : CO<sub>2</sub></p>
		<p>4. Hydrogen peroxide formula :	H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></p>

		<h2>Algebra Formulas</h2>
			
		<p> <b>Algebra</b> is a branch of Mathematics that substitutes letters for numbers. 
		An algebraic equation depicts a scale, what is done on one side of the scale 
		with a number is also done to either side of the scale. The numbers are constants.
		Algebra also includes real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, vectors and much more.
		X, Y, A, B are the most commonly used letters that represent the algebraic problems and equation 1/b.</p>
		
		<h4>Important Formulas in Algebra</h4>
		
			Here is a list of Algebraic formulas –

			<p>1. a<sup>2</sup> – b<sup>2 </sup>= (a – b)(a + b)</p>
			<p>2. (a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>3. a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = (a + b)<sup>2</sup> – 2ab</p>
			<p>4. (a – b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> – 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>5. (a + b + c)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca</p>
